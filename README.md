# FamilyTrackerUsingPernStack

Welcome to my **Family Tracker App**! This web application allows family members to track and share their travel plans, ensuring that everyone can stay updated on each other's locations and activities. Built with the **PERN stack** (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js), the app enables seamless communication and real-time updates between family members using **REST APIs** for data transfer.

## Folder Structure

### 1. **public/styles**
This folder contains the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) files used for styling the frontend of the Family Tracker App. It defines the visual aspects of the website such as the layout, colors, fonts, and overall design. All styles for the user interface are managed here.

### 2. **views**
The **views** folder holds the **EJS** templates that are used to render dynamic HTML content on the server-side. These templates are processed by the Express backend and passed to the client as fully-formed HTML.

- **index.ejs**: This is the main template file that serves as the homepage of the Family Tracker App, where users can view the current travel status and activities of their family members.

### 3. **index.js**
This is the main entry point for your Node.js server. It sets up the backend using **Express** to handle requests from the client and provide data using a **REST API**. The server processes incoming HTTP requests and interacts with the database to store and retrieve travel-related data.

- **REST API**: The server exposes routes that provide data to the frontend in response to API requests made by the client using **Axios**.

### 4. **package-lock.json**
This file is automatically generated when you run `npm install` and locks the dependencies of your project to a specific version, ensuring that all contributors and environments use the same package versions to avoid discrepancies.

### 5. **package.json**
This file contains metadata about your project, including the project name, version, and dependencies. It also defines the scripts needed to run or build the project (e.g., `npm start`, `npm run dev`) and lists all the npm packages required by the project.

### 6. **queries.sql**
This file contains the SQL queries needed to set up the **PostgreSQL** database for the Family Tracker App. These queries are used to create tables, insert initial data, and define relationships between the data needed to track family members' travels.

## Project Overview

The **Family Tracker App** enables families to keep track of their members' travel plans in real-time. Built with the **PERN stack**, the app allows family members to create travel plans, see where everyone is going, and stay connected. The app uses **RESTful APIs** to exchange data between the frontend and backend, and **Axios** is used to make HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Family Tracking**: Family members can share and track their travel locations in real-time.
- **RESTful API**: The app uses a REST API to transfer travel data, allowing for seamless communication between the frontend (React) and the backend (Node.js/Express).
- **Axios Integration**: Axios is used to make HTTP requests from the React frontend to the backend, handling data submission and retrieval.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: All travel-related data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, which is set up with the help of the **queries.sql** file.
- **User Interface**: The app provides an intuitive interface for users to view and update travel plans.

## Learning Outcomes

Through the development of this project, I gained hands-on experience in several areas, including:

### 1. **Building a Full-Stack Application with the PERN Stack**
- **What I learned**: I learned how to create a full-stack web application using the **PERN stack** (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js). I gained an understanding of how the different layers of the application work together, from the backend database to the API layer and the frontend interface.
- **Example**: The frontend (React) communicates with the backend (Express) via Axios and a REST API to manage and display the travel data.

### 2. **Working with REST APIs for Data Transfer**
- **What I learned**: I learned how to design and implement **REST APIs** to handle HTTP requests and responses. I also gained experience in how to transfer data from the frontend to the backend and vice versa, allowing dynamic updates to the web page.
- **Example**: The app uses `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` HTTP methods to interact with the backend. Axios is used to make requests, and the backend routes process them to manipulate the data in the database.

### 3. **Integrating Axios in React for HTTP Requests**
- **What I learned**: I learned how to use **Axios** to make HTTP requests from the React frontend to the Node.js backend. Axios simplifies the process of sending asynchronous requests to the server and handling responses.
- **Example**: In the React components, Axios is used to send data (e.g., travel plans) to the backend, and the data is rendered dynamically on the web page after it is returned from the server.

### 4. **Setting Up and Managing a PostgreSQL Database**
- **What I learned**: I learned how to set up and interact with a **PostgreSQL database** to store travel data. I also worked with **SQL queries** to create and manage tables, relationships, and data.
- **Example**: The **queries.sql** file contains all the necessary SQL statements for creating tables and inserting initial data to support the app's functionality, such as tracking family members' travel plans.

### 5. **Creating a User-Friendly Interface with React**
- **What I learned**: I developed skills in creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces using **React**. I learned about the importance of managing state, passing props, and using React's component-based architecture to build reusable UI elements.
- **Example**: React components such as the travel tracker and family member list update dynamically based on the data from the backend, providing an intuitive experience for users.

### 6. **Database and Data Flow Integration**
- **What I learned**: I gained experience in integrating data flow between the frontend, backend, and database. I learned how to use the database to store travel data, retrieve it, and update it based on user interactions.
- **Example**: Data entered by users on the frontend is sent to the backend through Axios, processed by the Express routes, and stored or updated in the PostgreSQL database.

### 7. **Version Control and Deployment**
- **What I learned**: I used **Git** for version control and learned how to deploy the application for production use. I also gained an understanding of how to manage different environments (e.g., development, production) for both frontend and backend.
- **Example**: I used Git to track the projectâ€™s development and deployed the app on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).

By completing this project, I gained a deeper understanding of full-stack web development, including how to integrate the **PERN stack** and **Axios** to create a seamless user experience for tracking and sharing travel data. This project helped me improve my skills in both frontend and backend development, as well as learn how to design APIs and interact with a relational database.

Feel free to explore the repository, clone it, or contribute to the project if you're interested in full-stack development or learning more about the **PERN stack**, **Axios**, and **REST APIs**.
